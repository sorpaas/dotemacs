Being an interviewee is really hard, and being an interviewer is even harder. Recently I am going to organize a TEDxHKBU event, and the first tough problem I've meet is recruitment. Co-curator and I only planned to get about 9 committee members. However, we've got about 90 applications, which made a three-day long interview period. I have got a hard time going through all those process. Here's something I want to say about it, and hope you could get some insights about it.

### Suffering from CVs

I have had really a hard time dealing with all those CVs. Firstly I tried to look through all CVs in detail, and thats really what I've done till the end. But I soon got headache when doing this. I was still trying and thats what happened after that.

- I will ignore those who write really short CVs, because I thought it would be really useless.
- I will feel really great if you could provide me something new, just because my headache.
- If you have some recent experience like what I have suffered in the past, I may probably hate it, because I think I just cannot save you.
