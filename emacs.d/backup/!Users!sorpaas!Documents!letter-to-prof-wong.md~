Dear Prof Wong,

Thank you for meeting with me this afternoon.

## Choosing My Major

Before high school, I had decided to do something about computer
science / artificial intelligence, so I learnt some of it when I was
in high school. At that time, some friends of my parents adviced me
many times to learn something other than Computer Science in
university, because that combination makes one have a wider vision of
knowledge. As a result, I am thinking about choosing from those two
subject currently.

I think mathematics and computer science are related at least in those
ways:

* One example is that I previously went to some postgraduate meetings
  about machine learning, and the research projects such as
  recommendation system is based on mathematics theories.
* Another example is from a friend of mine who is a master student in
  Chinese University of Hong Kong, he previously had a data anaylise
  project, which studied how to find patterns in big data. And you
  will need many mathematics knowledge if you want to make your
  program fast enough to be used in practise.
* In my own experience, I began to study something a litte bit about
  artificial intelligence this month. I found that some theories I was
  really interested in such as incompleteness theorem are actually in the
  field of mathematics.
